Biography
======
My name is Ruiyang Qin (秦睿阳). I joined the ECE Department at [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/academic-programs/electrical-computer/directory/biodetail.html?mail=ruiyang.qin@villanova.edu&xsl=bio_long) as an Assistant Professor in August 2025. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame in 2025 under the advice of Professor [Yiyu Shi](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html#director). I also work closely with Professor [Sharon Hu](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/xiaobo-sharon-hu/) and Professor [Jinjun Xiong](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/faculty-directory.host.html/content/shared/engineering/computer-science-engineering/profiles/faculty/ladder/xiong-jinjun.detail.html). I received DAC Young Fellow in 2023 and 2024, Edison Innovation Fellow in 2024, IAD Academic Fellowship in 2024, **Best Paper Award nomination** at ICCAD in 2024, and **Spotlight** at ICLR in 2025. 


[**Recruiting Ph.D. students and interns**] I am actively seeking highly motivated students for PhD, MS, and Research Intern positions. If you are interested, please send me your CV, transcripts, and brief descriptions about why you want to work with me.
